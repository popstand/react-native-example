# React Native App

This is an example of react native app working with graphql server implementation in Sails API.

## Running the App

- checkout to develop branch in app-api repo and run sails server
  `sails lift`
- Update server address in app.js
- node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start
- react-native run-android to run it on Android emulator / device


If you run into issues while running it on ios, let me know.
